# Life Expectancy Map Program

This program displays Life Expectancy data using Processing, and Unfolding Maps API.

It uses LifeExpectancyWorldBank data in CSV format and it can be found at http://data.worldbank.org.

The methodology to represent Life Expectancy was to color each country with high life expectancy with cool colors such as dark blue, and going towards warm colors as the expectancy drops, like red.

To underline the map and countries, a helper file countries.geo.json was used. It can be found here https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/blob/master/countries.geo.json

This is an example of what the program displays:
